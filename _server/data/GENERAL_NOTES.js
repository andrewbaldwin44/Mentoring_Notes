      In JavaScript, we want to use `let` anytime we have a **mutable** variable (one that we **will** be changed), \
      and `const` for **immutable** variables (ones that **are never** being changed). `var` is a special case that \
      we won't use very often. Check out [freecodecamp's article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference/) \

        We should move this constant to the top level (outside of the function).

      name: 'Abbreviations',
      note: " \
        I do recommend staying away from any abbreviations as their meaning can very easily \
        become lost or confusing to the reader. My rule of thumb is if we can't find the word \
        in a standard English dictionary, our variable name isn't clear enough. \

      name: 'Lightweight Initialize',
      note: " \
        So ideally we want to make our `initialize` as _lightweight_ as possible. You can think \
        of a Class like the Subway sandwich line. When someone asks for a `Sandwich.new()`, \
        the worker isn't going to start off by packing the sandwich with everything on the menu. \
        What if we don't want pickles? So rather they start you off with just the bread \
        (the bare minimum we need for a sandwich) and then the customer gets to pick and choose \
        which methods (toppings) they want to add on.<br><br> \
        \
        So it's a bit of a funny metaphor but hopefully you see what I'm getting at. We don't want \
        to do the work of calculating the `latest` score or the `personal_best` until the user asks \
        for it (simply because they may never ask for it). \
