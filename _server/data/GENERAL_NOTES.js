      note: " \
      So ideally we want to make our `initialize` as _lightweight_ as possible. You can think \
      of a Class like the Subway sandwich line. When someone asks for a `Sandwich.new()`, \
      the worker isn't going to start off by packing the sandwich with everything on the menu. \
      What if we don't want pickles? So rather they start you off with just the bread \
      (the bare minimum we need for a sandwich) and then the customer gets to pick and choose \
      which methods (toppings) they want to add on.<br><br> \
      \
      So it's a bit of a funny metaphor but hopefully you see what I'm getting at. We don't want \
      to do the work of calculating the `latest` score or the `personal_best` until the user asks \
      for it (simply because they may never ask for it). \
