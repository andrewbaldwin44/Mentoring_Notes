        Have a look at the Single Responsibility Principle of functions,
        meaning we only ever want our functions to handle one concern. Here,
        everything that is concerned with rounding is a seperate concern and
        should therefore be handled by a second function. We should see that
        this will help to make our code more readable.

        (numbers that appear out of thin air with no explanation!).
        Many readers won't know what `` is meant to
        represent. So how can we more clearly convey it's meaning?
